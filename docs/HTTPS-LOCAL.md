# + HTTPS + auth for local admin UIs

> Return to [Setup Guide](SETUP.md) · Requires [+ local DNS](LOCAL-DNS.md) already set up

Adds basic-auth and HTTPS to every local-only `.lan` host: Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, Bazarr,
qBittorrent, SABnzbd, Pi-hole, Uptime Kuma, duc, Beszel, the `traefik.lan` dashboard, and — since
the Jellyfin/Seerr extension — Jellyfin and Seerr too. Several of the original hosts (qBittorrent by
explicit design) have no auth of their own on the LAN, so this is their only gate. Jellyfin and
Seerr already have real app-level auth of their own; the basicauth layer here is an intentional
extra gate on top, applied uniformly with everything else in this tier — see the caveat below
before relying on it for TV/mobile clients.

**Caveat for Jellyfin/Seerr specifically**: unlike the other hosts, these are used by non-browser
clients on `.lan` — Kodi, the Jellyfin Android/iOS/tvOS apps, Chromecast, smart TV apps, the Seerr
companion apps. Many of these don't support an HTTP Basic Auth challenge the way a browser does, so
adding this gate can break their direct `.lan` connection even though the app's own login still
works fine in a browser. If a device stops connecting after this change, options are: enter the
basicauth credentials once if the client supports a credential prompt (some do, embedded in the
URL as `https://user:pass@jellyfin.lan`), point that device at the app's LAN-published port
directly instead of the `.lan` hostname (bypasses Traefik and this gate entirely, no TLS), or drop
`admin-auth@docker` from `jellyfin-lan-secure`/`seerr-lan-secure` in
`traefik/dynamic/local-services.yml` for TLS-only treatment of these two hosts.

This uses a **locally-trusted internal CA** (via [`mkcert`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)),
not a public CA — `.lan` isn't a real, publicly-resolvable domain, so Let's Encrypt can't issue for
it, and running a full ACME server (step-ca) for a single-user home setup is unnecessary
complexity. The tradeoff: every personal device needs the CA's root cert installed once before it
trusts `https://sonarr.lan` etc. without a browser warning.

**Step 1: Generate the CA + cert (once, on your own machine — not the NAS)**

```bash
brew install mkcert          # macOS; see mkcert's README for other platforms
mkcert -install               # installs the CA into this machine's trust store
mkcert -cert-file lan-admin.crt -key-file lan-admin.key \
  sonarr.lan radarr.lan prowlarr.lan bazarr.lan qbit.lan sabnzbd.lan \
  traefik.lan pihole.lan uptime.lan duc.lan beszel.lan jellyfin.lan seerr.lan
```

This creates two files (`lan-admin.crt`, `lan-admin.key`) signed by a CA whose private key never
leaves this machine — only the leaf cert/key pair goes to the NAS.

**Why an explicit host list instead of a `*.lan` wildcard**: OpenSSL-family TLS stacks (curl, and
most browsers) refuse wildcard matching against a single-label suffix like `.lan` — they treat it
like a public-suffix boundary, the same protection that stops a CA from usefully issuing `*.com`.
mkcert's own README flags this as a known caveat; confirmed here empirically (`curl` failed a
`*.lan` cert with "subjectAltName does not match host name"). An explicit SAN list sidesteps the
whole issue — the tradeoff is that **adding a new `.lan` admin host means regenerating this cert**
with the extra hostname appended and redeploying (Steps 1–2, then Step 4).

**Step 2: Deploy the cert to the NAS**

`traefik/certs/` is gitignored (like `traefik.yml` itself) — copy the two files there directly,
they aren't synced by `git pull`:

```bash
scp -O lan-admin.crt lan-admin.key cloud-nas:/volume1/docker/arr-stack/traefik/certs/
ssh cloud-nas 'chmod 644 /volume1/docker/arr-stack/traefik/certs/lan-admin.key'
```

The `chmod 644` on the key matters: this NAS's Docker daemon userns-remaps container root to an
unprivileged host UID, so Traefik (running as container-root) can't read a `600` key owned by a
different host user — it silently falls back to its own self-signed default cert instead of
erroring, which looks like "HTTPS works" until a client actually checks the cert chain.

**Step 3: Set the admin-UI password (reuses the Traefik dashboard credential)**

If `TRAEFIK_DASHBOARD_AUTH` is already set in `.env` on the NAS, there's nothing to do — the
`admin-auth` middleware reuses it. To use a different password for the local admin tier, add a
separate `ADMIN_UI_AUTH` var (same `htpasswd -nbB admin 'YOUR_PASSWORD'` format) and point
`docker-compose.traefik.yml`'s `admin-auth` label at it instead.

**Step 4: Recreate Traefik**

```bash
cd /volume1/docker/arr-stack
docker compose -f docker-compose.traefik.yml up -d --force-recreate
```

**Step 5: Trust the CA on every personal device**

`mkcert -install` (Step 1) only trusted the CA on the machine that ran it. For every other
device that should see a green padlock instead of a warning:

- Find the CA root cert: `mkcert -CAROOT` (on the machine from Step 1) → `rootCA.pem`.
- **Other Macs/PCs:** run `mkcert -install` there too, using the *same* `rootCA-key.pem`/
  `rootCA.pem` (copy the whole `mkcert -CAROOT` directory over) — otherwise each machine mints
  its own independent CA and none of them will trust each other's certs.
- **Android:** transfer `rootCA.pem` to the device (AirDrop/email/USB), then
  Settings → Security → Encryption & credentials → Install a certificate → CA certificate.
- **iOS:** AirDrop `rootCA.pem`, install the profile in Settings, then separately enable full
  trust under Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings.

Skipping this step doesn't break anything functionally — the padlock just shows a warning on
devices that haven't trusted the CA, same as any self-signed cert.

**Verification**

- `https://sonarr.lan` (and the other 12 hosts, including `jellyfin.lan`/`seerr.lan`) load with no
  cert warning on a CA-trusted device, and prompt for basic-auth before showing the app.
- `http://sonarr.lan` (and every other host) redirects (301) to its `https://` equivalent.
- The Cloudflare-facing public URLs (`jellyfin.yourdomain.com` etc.) are unaffected — Cloudflare
  Tunnel still targets Traefik's `web` (:80) entrypoint, not `websecure`, and those routers are
  defined separately from the `.lan` ones touched here.

**Cert renewal**: `mkcert`-issued leaf certs are valid for ~2.25 years (the CA root itself lasts
~10). Repeat Steps 1–4 (skip `-install`, the CA already exists at `mkcert -CAROOT`) before it
expires — there's no automated renewal here, this is a manual, infrequent step.
