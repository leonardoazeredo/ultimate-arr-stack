Optional tuning and advanced features. None of these are required — your stack works fine without them.

## Hardware Transcoding (Intel Quick Sync)

Recommended for Ugreen NAS (DXP4800+, etc.) with Intel CPUs. Enables GPU-accelerated transcoding — reduces CPU usage from ~80% to ~20%.

> **No Intel GPU?** Remove the `devices:` and `group_add:` lines (4 lines total) from the jellyfin service in `docker-compose.arr-stack.yml`, or Jellyfin won't start.

**1. Find your render group ID:**
```bash
# SSH to your NAS and run:
getent group render | cut -d: -f3
```

**2. Add to your `.env`:**
```bash
RENDER_GROUP_ID=105  # Use the number from step 1
```

**3. Recreate Jellyfin:**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.arr-stack.yml up -d jellyfin
```

**4. Configure Jellyfin:** Dashboard → Playback → Transcoding

![Jellyfin transcoding settings](images/jellyfin/jellyfin-transcoding.png)

**Key settings:**
- **Hardware acceleration:** Intel QuickSync (QSV)
- **Enable hardware decoding for:** H264, HEVC, MPEG2, VC1, VP8, VP9, HEVC 10bit, VP9 10bit
- **Prefer OS native DXVA or VA-API hardware decoders:** ✅
- **Enable hardware encoding:** ✅
- **Enable Intel Low-Power H.264/HEVC encoders:** ✅
- **Allow encoding in HEVC format:** ✅
- **Enable VPP Tone mapping:** ✅

**5. Configure Trickplay:** Dashboard → Playback → Trickplay

Trickplay generates preview thumbnails when you hover over the video timeline.

![Jellyfin trickplay settings](images/jellyfin/jellyfin-trickplay.png)

**Enable these for GPU-accelerated thumbnail generation:**
- **Enable hardware decoding:** ✅
- **Enable hardware accelerated MJPEG encoding:** ✅
- **Only generate images from key frames:** ✅ (faster, minimal quality impact)

**6. Verify it's working:**

1. Click your user icon → **Settings** → **Playback**
2. Set **Quality** to a low value (e.g., 720p 1Mbps)
3. Play a video and open **Playback Info** (⚙️ → Playback Info)
4. Look for **"Transcoding framerate"** — should show **10x+ realtime** (e.g., 400+ fps)
5. Check CPU usage — should stay ~20-30% instead of 80%+

If transcoding framerate is only ~1x (24-30 fps), hardware acceleration isn't working.

## Kodi for Fire TV (Dolby Vision / TrueHD Atmos)

**When to use Kodi instead of the Jellyfin app:**

The Jellyfin Android TV app works well for most content. However, it may not properly pass through advanced audio/video formats to your AV receiver. If you're experiencing:

- High CPU usage / transcoding on 4K HDR or Dolby Vision content
- Audio being converted instead of passing through TrueHD Atmos or DTS-HD
- Playback stuttering or buffering on high-bitrate files

...try **Kodi with the Jellyfin add-on** instead. Kodi handles passthrough more reliably on Fire TV devices.

**Step 1: Install Kodi on Fire TV (sideload via ADB)**

Kodi isn't in the Amazon App Store. Install via ADB from your computer:

```bash
# Install ADB (Mac)
brew install android-platform-tools

# Enable on Fire TV: Settings → My Fire TV → Developer Options → ADB debugging → ON

# Connect (replace FIRETV_IP with your Fire TV's IP)
adb connect FIRETV_IP:5555
# Accept the prompt on your TV screen

# Download and install Kodi (32-bit for Fire TV)
curl -L -o /tmp/kodi.apk "https://mirrors.kodi.tv/releases/android/arm/kodi-21.3-Omega-armeabi-v7a.apk"
adb install /tmp/kodi.apk
```

**Step 2: Install Jellyfin add-on in Kodi**

First, push the Jellyfin repo to Fire TV:
```bash
curl -L -o /tmp/jellyfin-repo.zip "https://kodi.jellyfin.org/repository.jellyfin.kodi.zip"
adb push /tmp/jellyfin-repo.zip /sdcard/Download/
```

Then in Kodi on Fire TV:
1. Settings → Add-ons → Install from zip file
2. Enable unknown sources if prompted
3. Select External storage → Download → `jellyfin-repo.zip`
4. Wait for "Add-on installed" notification
5. Install from repository → Jellyfin Kodi Add-ons → Video add-ons → Jellyfin → Install

**Step 3: Fix "Unable to connect" error**

Jellyfin in Docker reports its internal Docker IP to clients, which they can't reach. Fix by setting the published server URI:

```bash
# SSH to NAS and run (replace NAS_IP with your actual NAS IP):
docker exec jellyfin sed -i 's|<PublishedServerUriBySubnet />|<PublishedServerUriBySubnet><string>0.0.0.0/0=http://NAS_IP:8096</string></PublishedServerUriBySubnet>|' /config/config/network.xml

docker compose -f docker-compose.arr-stack.yml restart jellyfin
```

**Step 4: Connect and configure**

1. In Kodi, the Jellyfin add-on should auto-discover your server
2. Select it and login with your Jellyfin credentials
3. Choose **Add-on** mode when prompted

**Step 5: Enable passthrough in Kodi**

Settings → System → Audio:
- Allow passthrough: **On**
- Dolby TrueHD capable receiver: **On**
- DTS-HD capable receiver: **On**
- Passthrough output device: your AV receiver

Now 4K Dolby Vision + TrueHD Atmos content will direct play without transcoding.

## RAID5 Streaming Tuning

If you're using RAID5 with spinning HDDs and experience playback stuttering on large files (especially 4K remuxes), the default read-ahead buffer is too small. Apply this tuning on your NAS:

```bash
sudo bash -c '
echo 4096 > /sys/block/md1/queue/read_ahead_kb
echo 4096 > /sys/block/dm-0/queue/read_ahead_kb
echo 4096 > /sys/block/md1/md/stripe_cache_size
'
```

Add a root crontab `@reboot` job to persist across reboots (do **not** use `/etc/rc.local` — UGOS overwrites it on firmware updates). See [Troubleshooting: Jellyfin Video Stutters](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#jellyfin-video-stuttersfreezes-every-few-minutes) for full details.

## Torrents Are Handled by TorBox

There is no local torrent client to tune any more. Sonarr/Radarr hand a torrent release to
Decypharr, which asks TorBox to fetch it and then pulls the finished file back over HTTPS — no
torrent peer traffic leaves this host, so the connection, encryption, µTP, seeding-limit and
peer-whitelist settings a local BitTorrent client needed do not apply here. The queue, its
progress and any per-release retry live in Decypharr's own WebUI on `http://NAS_IP:8282`.

What still needs tuning on the torrent path is on the *arr* side: the download client entry
(`decypharr:8282`, category `tv`/`movies`) and, if you want Usenet tried first, the delay profile —
see [Prefer Usenet over Torrents](APP-CONFIG.md#prefer-usenet-over-torrents-optional).

## SABnzbd Hardening (TRaSH Recommended)

These settings follow [TRaSH Guides SABnzbd recommendations](https://trash-guides.info/Downloaders/SABnzbd/Basic-Setup/):

**Config (⚙️) → Sorting:**
- **Enable TV Sorting:** ❌
- **Enable Movie Sorting:** ❌
- **Enable Date Sorting:** ❌

> Sorting must be disabled — Sonarr/Radarr handle all file organization. SABnzbd sorting causes files to end up in unexpected paths.

**Config (⚙️) → Switches:**
- **Propagation delay:** `5` minutes (waits for Usenet propagation before downloading)
- **Check result of unpacking:** ✅ (only processes successfully unpacked jobs)
- **Deobfuscate final filenames:** ✅ (cleans up obfuscated filenames)

**Config (⚙️) → Special:**
- **Unwanted extensions:** Add common junk file extensions. See [TRaSH's full list](https://trash-guides.info/Downloaders/SABnzbd/Basic-Setup/#unwanted-extensions) for the recommended blacklist.

### SABnzbd hostname whitelist (.lan DNS)

If using Pi-hole local DNS, add `sabnzbd.lan` to the hostname whitelist:
- Config (⚙️) → Special → **host_whitelist** → add `sabnzbd.lan`
- Save, then restart SABnzbd container

Or via SSH:
```bash
docker exec sabnzbd sed -i 's/^host_whitelist = .*/&, sabnzbd.lan/' /config/sabnzbd.ini
docker restart sabnzbd
```
