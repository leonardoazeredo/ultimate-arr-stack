## Architecture

### Network Topology

```
Internet → Cloudflare Tunnel (or Router Port Forward 80→8080, 443→8443)
                            │
                            ▼
           Traefik (listening on 8080/8443 on NAS)
                            │
                            ├─► Jellyfin, Seerr, Bazarr (Direct)

                                        (Privacy-protected services)
```

### Multi-File Architecture

This project uses **separate Docker Compose files** for each layer:

| File | Layer | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- | --------- |
| `docker-compose.traefik.yml` | Infrastructure | Reverse proxy, SSL, networking |
| `docker-compose.cloudflared.yml` | Infrastructure | External access via Cloudflare |
| `docker-compose.arr-stack.yml` | Application | Media services |
| `docker-compose.utilities.yml` | Optional | Monitoring, disk usage tools |

**Why separate files?**

- Independent lifecycle management
- One Traefik can serve multiple stacks
- Easier troubleshooting with isolated logs
- Optional components can be skipped

**Deployment order**: arr-stack first (creates network) → Traefik → cloudflared → utilities (optional).

### Storage Structure

```
/volume1/
├── Media/
│   ├── downloads/    # Decypharr (TorBox)
│   ├── tv/           # TV shows
│   └── movies/       # Movies
└── docker/
    └── arr-stack/
        ├── traefik/       # User-edited (bind mount)
        └── cloudflared/   # User-edited (bind mount)
```

**Service data** (Sonarr, Radarr, Jellyfin, etc.) is stored in Docker named volumes (e.g., `arr-stack_sonarr-config`), not in the repo directory. Use `scripts/arr-backup.sh` to back them up.

---

## Documentation Strategy

This project separates public documentation from private configuration:

| Type | Location | Git Tracked | Contains |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| **Public docs** | `docs/*.md`, `README.md` | Yes | Generic instructions with placeholders |
| **Config templates** | `*.example` files | Yes | Templates with `yourdomain.com` placeholders |
| **Your configs** | `traefik/*.yml`, `.env` | No | Your actual domain, customizations |
| **Private config** | `.claude/config.local.md` | No | Actual hostnames, IPs, usernames |
| **Credentials** | `.env` | No | Passwords, API tokens, private keys |

### Reporting counts

Any number this repository quotes about its own tree counts **first-party files
only**, and says what it excluded. Three things inflate a naive walk:

- `tests/bats-core`, `tests/bats-support` and `tests/bats-assert` are vendored
  submodules, and they are the majority of the shell files in a checkout;
- `.claude/worktrees/` holds throwaway copies of the tree from past sessions;
- `tests/fixtures/` holds inputs that tests read, not source files.

A raw walk roughly doubles every shell-file, shell-line, shebang and
safety-pattern count against the first-party figure, so state the exclusion next
to the number. Better, derive it at run time: the CI census counts what the suite
actually executed, and `tests/shellcheck.bats` derives the unswept-file list from
`TARGETS` rather than from anything written down. Stale hand-written counts are
this repository's most repeated documentation defect: `CLAUDE.md`'s old "14
tests" claim and `ci.yml`'s corpus-entry count both outlived the thing they
described.

### Image pinning

Runtime images are pinned. Every `image:` in a compose file carries an explicit
tag, no `:latest`, and `tests/compose-validation.bats` asserts it, which is why
the stack's upgrades are deliberate.

Build images are pinned by base tag or digest, and where a step inside them
still floats, the Dockerfile says so and why. The two CI tool images
(`tests/mutation`, `tests/toolkit`) are pinned by digest because a floating
toolchain there would move the oracle under the mutation corpus. The
`.devcontainer` image floats on purpose and carries the same note: nothing in it
is deployed, so a bad upstream release breaks an editor, not the NAS.

Lockfiles are a separate axis and are NOT committed for the three Node
subprojects (`package-lock.json` is gitignored), so their `npm install` resolves
against `package.json` on every build. That is deliberate today; a Dockerfile
that depends on it says so.

### Config File Pattern

Files requiring domain customization use the `.example` pattern:

```bash
# On first setup, copy templates and customize
cp traefik/traefik.yml.example traefik/traefik.yml
cp traefik/dynamic/vpn-services.yml.example traefik/dynamic/vpn-services.yml
# Edit both files: replace yourdomain.com with your actual domain
```

The actual `.yml` files are gitignored, so:

- `git pull` updates only `.example` files (won't overwrite your config)
- To get new features, manually merge changes from `.example` to your `.yml`

**Setup**: Copy `.claude/config.local.md.example` to `.claude/config.local.md` and fill in your values.

## Pre-commit Hooks

This repo includes validation hooks that run on `git commit`:

| Check | Blocks? | Purpose |
| ------- | --------- | --------- |
| Secrets | Yes | Detects real API keys, private keys, bcrypt hashes |
| Env vars | Yes | Ensures compose `${VAR}` are documented in `.env.example` |
| YAML syntax | Yes | Catches invalid YAML before it breaks deployment |
| Port/IP conflicts | Yes | Detects duplicate ports or static IPs |
| Hardcoded domain | Block | Detects your hostname in tracked files (leaks identity) |
| Hardcoded domain | Warn | Detects your domain in tracked files (may be intentional) |
| NAS .env backup | Warn | Checks `.env.nas.backup` matches NAS |
| Uptime monitors | Warn | Checks Uptime Kuma monitors match services |

**Security note**: The secrets and hardcoded domain checks scan **all tracked files** in the repo, not just staged changes. This catches issues that may have been committed before these checks existed.

### Install

```bash
./setup-hooks.sh
```

### Optional: PyYAML for full YAML validation

The YAML syntax check works best with PyYAML installed. Without it, only basic checks (tab detection) run.

```bash
pip3 install --break-system-packages --user pyyaml
```

### Test manually

```bash
./scripts/pre-commit
```

### Uninstall

```bash
rm .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### SSH-based Checks (NAS .env backup, Uptime monitors)

The last two checks require SSH access to your NAS. They gracefully skip when:

- NAS is not reachable (ping fails)
- SSH port is blocked/closed
- SSH authentication fails

**To enable these checks:**

1. **SSH key authentication** (recommended):

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id your-user@your-nas.local
   ```

2. **Docker group membership** (for Uptime monitors check):

   ```bash
   # On NAS - allows docker commands without sudo
   sudo usermod -aG docker your-user
   # Log out and back in for group change to take effect
   ```

3. **Alternative: password auth** via `NAS_SSH_PASS` env var (requires `sshpass` installed)

## Releases

### The flow, end to end (branch-first — prevents version drift)

Every version-changing release follows this order. Doing it as one unbroken flow is what stops the CHANGELOG, tags, and GitHub releases from drifting out of sync with each other (which they have before — e.g. 1.7.19/1.7.20 shipped in commit messages with no CHANGELOG entry or release).

1. **Branch.** Make the change on a feature branch (`fix/…`, `chore/…`), commit, push.
2. **CHANGELOG entry, same branch.** Add a `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section. This is not optional — a version bump with no CHANGELOG entry is an incomplete release. ⚠️ **Do NOT paste your real domain or NAS hostname into the entry** (e.g. `jellyfin.yourhost.cc`) — the pre-commit "Hardcoded domain" check **blocks** the commit on the hostname. Describe verification generically ("Jellyfin returned HTTP 302 through the tunnel"), not by URL.
3. **Deploy + verify on the NAS from the branch** (see CLAUDE.md → "Deploying to the NAS"): `git checkout <branch>` on the NAS, recreate the affected service(s) via compose, run the Pre-release Checklist below. Back up the config volume first for any service with a DB migration (Pi-hole, the \*arrs).
4. **Merge to `main`, push, sync the NAS** (`git checkout main && git pull`).
5. **Publish:** `gh release create vX.Y.Z --title vX.Y.Z --notes "…"` (this also creates the tag). A "tag" always means a full GitHub release with notes — never a bare `git tag`.

### Pre-release Checklist

**Every release MUST pass these checks before merging to `main` and tagging. No exceptions.**

1. **Run all BATS tests** (includes image tag validation):

   ```bash
   tests/bats-core/bin/bats tests/
   ```

2. **Verify all image tags are pullable on the NAS** — a full tear-down and pull:

   ```bash
   # SSH to the NAS, then for each compose file being released:
   cd $NAS_STACK_DIR
   docker compose -f docker-compose.arr-stack.yml pull
   docker compose -f docker-compose.traefik.yml pull
   docker compose -f docker-compose.utilities.yml pull
   ```

   Every image must pull successfully. Cached images mask bad tags — a fresh `pull` is the only way to be sure.

3. **Bring the stack up** and verify services start:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.traefik.yml up -d
   docker compose -f docker-compose.arr-stack.yml up -d
   # Check all containers are healthy
   docker ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}'
   ```

4. **Run E2E tests** — verify all UIs load and API responses are correct:

   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

   This logs into each service, takes screenshots of every dashboard, and asserts root folders and media libraries are present. Every test must pass. Screenshots are saved to `tests/e2e/screenshots/` for visual review.

### Tagging and Publishing

**Normal path — publish a new release** (creates the tag and the GitHub release together):

```bash
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Changed
- **Service** old → new. One line on how it was verified on the NAS.
EOF
)"
```

Keep the notes hostname-free (same rule as the CHANGELOG). The release notes are the CHANGELOG entry, lightly trimmed.

**Edge case — moving an existing tag.** Force-pushing a tag resets the GitHub release to Draft status. After moving a tag to a new commit:

```bash
# Move tag to new commit
git tag -d v1.x && git tag v1.x
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.x && git push origin v1.x

# REQUIRED: Fix the release status (force-push sets it to Draft)
gh release edit v1.x --draft=false --latest
```

Without the `gh release edit` step, the release stays Draft and won't show as Latest.

<!-- /SCRIPTS-TREE-ORACLE -->

The `common.sh` library provides shared functions used by all checks:

- **NAS config**: Reads hostname/user from `.claude/config.local.md`
- **Domain config**: Reads domain from `.env` or `.env.nas.backup`
- **SSH helpers**: Standardized SSH commands with timeouts
- **File scanning**: Functions to get tracked/staged files

### Bash gotcha: command substitution under `set -e`

A script running with `set -e` (exit on error) exits immediately if a command
substitution's command fails — including an SSH call that just couldn't reach
the NAS. Add `|| true` and check for an empty result instead of letting the
whole script die on a transient failure:

```bash
# WRONG - script exits if SSH fails
result=$(ssh_to_nas "some command")

# RIGHT - gracefully handle SSH failure
result=$(ssh_to_nas "some command") || true
if [[ -z "$result" ]]; then
    echo "SKIP: SSH failed"
    return 0
fi
```

Used in `scripts/lib/check-env-backup.sh` and `check-uptime-monitors.sh`.
