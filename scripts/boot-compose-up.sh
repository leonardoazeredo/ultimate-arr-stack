# Reconcile every deployed compose stack after a reboot or a UGOS update.
#
# Why this exists: Docker's `restart: always` is not enough. A UGOS update on
# 5 Aug 2026 left every container *running* but with its published ports never
# established — Pi-hole reported healthy (its healthcheck digs 127.0.0.1 from
# inside the container, so it passes even when nothing outside can reach it)
# while nothing was listening on the NAS's LAN IP:53. DNS was down for the whole house
# and the NAS looked fine from `docker ps`.
#
# `docker compose up -d` reconciles each container against its compose file and
# re-establishes the port bindings, which is the part a restart misses.
#
# Deliberately NOT using --remove-orphans: containers from the other compose
# files in the same directory look like orphans to each individual file, and it
# would delete them.
