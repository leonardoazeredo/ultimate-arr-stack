# Safe stack restart - NEVER uses 'down' which kills Pi-hole DNS
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/restart-stack.sh           # Restart all compose files
#   ./scripts/restart-stack.sh arr       # Restart arr-stack only
#   ./scripts/restart-stack.sh traefik   # Restart traefik only
#   ./scripts/restart-stack.sh utilities # Restart utilities only
#   ./scripts/restart-stack.sh magnetio  # Restart the magnetio addon only
#
# "all" means every compose file in the repo EXCEPT docker-compose.tailscale.yml,
# and that exclusion is deliberate: recreating Tailscale node 1 severs every path
# to the NAS at once -- SSH and the UGOS admin UI both ride its own subnet route,
# so the command that would fix it arrives over the link it just cut. Rotate or
# restart that one by hand, detached, with a state-volume backup. See CLAUDE.md.
#
# tests/restart-stack.bats derives the covered set from the filesystem, so a new
# docker-compose.*.yml fails the suite until someone decides which list it joins.
#
# ORDER IN THE "all" ARM IS A DEPENDENCY ORDER, read off the compose files
# themselves, not a preference:
#
#   magnetio  creates magnetio-net, which docker-compose.arr-stack.yml declares
#             `external: true` and gluetun joins. That file says so in a comment:
#             recreate gluetun without it and you get "network not found".
#   arr-stack creates arr-core AND holds pihole/dnscrypt-proxy, so it is both the
#             network owner and the DNS the rest of the house needs.
#   traefik,  all declare arr-core `external: true`, so none of them can come up
#   cloudflared,  before the file that creates it. docs/UPGRADING.md states this
#   utilities     directly: "Start arr-stack first - it now owns the network.
#             Traefik and utilities reference it as external: true."
#             Cloudflared additionally forwards to http://traefik:80.
#
# This arm ran traefik first until 2026-09-01, which is backwards on both counts.
# It survived because the networks already existed on the one machine it was ever
# run on -- `up -d` on an existing external network is a no-op. On a machine where
# arr-core was absent (fresh deploy, or after a network prune) traefik would fail,
# and `set -e` means the run would abort BEFORE arr-stack, so the recovery command
# for a house with no DNS would itself never start DNS.
