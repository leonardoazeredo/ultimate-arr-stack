# Detects the credential-propagation bug class that has now silently broken
# this stack twice: Seerr's cached Sonarr/Radarr keys going stale after a
# declarative rotation (2026-08-17), and Radarr/Sonarr's Indexer entries
# caching a stale Prowlarr key (also 2026-08-17, found by this script's own
# predecessor) - in both cases nothing surfaced it beyond a UI warning
# nobody was looking at, until background jobs started silently 401ing.
#
# Calls each app's own live "test connection" API directly (indexer/testall,
# applications/test, the service/{app}/0 probe Seerr's own UI uses) rather
# than scanning logs - a real auth check, not a guess from log text. Bazarr
# is the one exception: it has no equivalent live-test endpoint, so it still
# falls back to a log scan.
#
# Runs entirely on the NAS itself (systemd calls this script directly, not
# over SSH) using `docker exec`/`docker logs`/`curl localhost` - needs no
# Bitwarden access of its own. Sonarr/Radarr/Prowlarr's own keys come from
# .env (declarative self-keys, already there for docker-compose - not a new
# secret). Bazarr and Seerr have no declarative self-key, so this reads
# THEIR OWN key straight from their own already-running config each time via
# `docker exec` - the only other place those two keys live is Bitwarden,
# which needs a master password this script deliberately never touches (see
# the detect-and-alert design note in CLAUDE.md/memory, 2026-08-17: the
# user's vault master key must never be stored anywhere but their own head,
# so a scheduled job can fix nothing that needs `bw unlock` - it can only
# detect and point at the manual fix).
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/detect-credential-drift.sh
#   (needs RADARR_API_KEY/SONARR_API_KEY/PROWLARR_API_KEY exported - the
#   systemd unit sources these from .env via EnvironmentFile)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = every live connectivity test passed
#   1 = one or more apps failed a live auth test (or the check itself
#       couldn't reach an app - treated as a finding, not silently skipped)
#
# Fix for a real finding: from a local checkout (not the NAS),
#   cd terraform && bw unlock && ./apply.sh
#
# Run on a schedule via the systemd timer alongside this script
# (detect-credential-drift.timer) - installing that needs root, see the
# .timer/.service files next to this one.
