# Shellcheck baseline.
#
# This file was merged as coverage and then never ran once, on any machine in
# this project. It skipped when `shellcheck` was absent, and shellcheck is
# absent on pi1 AND on the NAS -- the only two hosts that run this suite. So it
# reported a green skip forever while checking nothing, which is the same shape
# as the four tests this repo has already had to throw out for being incapable
# of failing. It now runs through `koalaman/shellcheck:stable` when no host
# binary exists, the pattern this repo already uses for tools the host lacks
# (alpine/git for git, the Playwright image for e2e), and skips only when
# neither shellcheck nor Docker is available -- saying which.
#
# The file list is derived from shebangs, not from `scripts/*.sh`. The old glob
# silently excluded `scripts/post-merge` and `scripts/pre-commit` -- both git
# hooks, both load-bearing, both extensionless -- along with the CGI scripts in
# duc-service/ and this suite's own tooling. A file becomes covered the moment
# it declares itself a shell script, rather than whenever someone remembers to
# widen a glob.
#
# Scoped to `-S error` only: the repo carries pre-existing info/warning-level
# findings (SC2086 unquoted vars, SC2012 `ls` usage, SC2034 unused vars) that
# are out of scope here. This check exists to catch genuine bugs -- broken
# syntax, invalid redirections, an unknown dialect -- not to gate on style.
# Widening the severity stays a separate, deliberate decision.
