# duc-service/app/{scan,manual_scan,startup}.sh and manual_scan.cgi.
#
# These four files are a single protocol, not four scripts, and testing any one
# of them alone leaves the interesting half unobserved:
#
#   manual_scan.cgi  PRODUCES a request marker (or declines to)
#   manual_scan.sh   CONSUMES it, once a minute, from cron
#   scan.sh          holds the lock the other two branch on
#   startup.sh       writes the crontab that runs the poller at all
#
# The race that used to lose a user's manual scan request lives in the seam
# between the producer and the consumer, so both halves are driven here.
#
# Everything runs against a throwaway tree via the DUC_* seams. They exist only
# for this file: the image sets none of them, so the container runs the same
# absolute paths that used to be hardcoded.
