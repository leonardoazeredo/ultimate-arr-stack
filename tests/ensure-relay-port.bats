#
# This script's whole job is a decision: does node 1's RelayServerPort already
# read 41641, or does `tailscale set` have to run again. Everything else is one
# line either way, so the decision is what these tests pin -- against every JSON
# shape the script's own L43-55 comment claims to survive, in BOTH directions.
#
# One direction is easy to get wrong and impossible to notice: a pattern that
# never matches makes the script re-apply on every timer tick forever, which
# LOOKS fine (the port ends up correct) and means the "already correct" branch
# is dead. So each shape is asserted as either "recognised" or "not recognised",
# never merely "the script exited 0".
#
# Nothing here can reach a live Tailscale. `tailscale set` is on the stub
# harness's denylist, so the re-apply path is observed as a forbid() trip at
# status 99 rather than by letting the call through -- node 1 carries SSH and
# the UGOS admin UI, and it is not a thing to touch from a test.
