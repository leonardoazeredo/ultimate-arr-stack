# scripts/restart-stack.sh, and the proof that the harness guarding it works.
#
# Every path through this script ends in `docker compose ... up -d
# --force-recreate` against the live stack. On the NAS that is Pi-hole, Traefik
# and the VPN tunnel going down and back up. It is the single most destructive
# script in the repo to drive from a test, which makes it the right one to
# prove the safety harness against: if forbid() can stop THIS, the rest of
# Phase 3 is safe to write.
#
# The first five tests are that proof and touch no production code: the harness
# had to be trustworthy BEFORE anything was refactored on the strength of it.
#
# The dispatcher's own behaviour - aliases, the ${1:-all} default, the file
# mapping, the dependency ordering of the `all` arm - cannot be observed through
# those, because forbid() kills the script at its FIRST compose call and `all`
# has five. So the second half extracts the `case` block with awk and evals it
# with restart_compose overridden, which is this repo's existing idiom for
# reaching a unit that a real run would never return from
# (backup-volume-resolution.bats). The docker stub stays installed underneath:
# if the extraction were ever wrong and a real call escaped, the harness is
# still there to make it a loud failure rather than a live restart.
