# This check has two halves with DIFFERENT severities, and the difference is the
# whole point of the file:
#
#   * the domain half WARNS - a domain in a Traefik dynamic config is often
#     unavoidable, so it prints and returns 0.
#   * the hostname half BLOCKS - the NAS's hostname is private, and the file
#     says so at L58: "BLOCKS - this should never be committed". It is the only
#     `return 1` in the file.
#
# Every test below names which half it is exercising, because a test that
# conflates them would pass while the blocking half was doing nothing.

# --- The errexit contract ---------------------------------------------------
#
# scripts/pre-commit runs under `set -e` and sources this file into itself, so
# the check's behaviour depends on something invisible at its own call site:
# whether the caller wrapped it in `if`. Inside an `if` condition bash suppresses
# errexit for the whole callee, so a mid-function command returning 1 is
# harmless; called bare, the same command kills the hook where it stands.
#
# That is exactly how this file used to fail. `((hostname_errors++))` sat inside
# the loop that builds the leak report, post-increment on a counter starting at
# 0, so it returned 1 on the first hit -- and check 5 called the function bare.
# The hook died mid-loop: no ERROR message, no file list, the `return 1` at :81
# never reached, and its last line of output an unrelated SKIP from check 5's
# own preamble. The commit was still rejected, by the abort rather than by the
# check, which is why a correct-looking exit code hid it.
#
# So these pin the contract the library owes ANY caller, rather than the one it
# happens to get from today's.

# Run a check the way a caller with errexit armed and no `if` wrapper would.
#
# This cannot be done in-process, and the reason is worth stating because every
# obvious attempt silently passes: `run` clears errexit, an `if` condition
# suppresses it inside the callee, and even `( set -e; f ) || rc=$?` suppresses
# it -- a subshell that is the left operand of `||` runs with errexit disabled
# no matter what `set -e` appears inside it. Each idiom bats offers to CATCH the
# abort is also an idiom that PREVENTS it. Only a separate process sees it.
