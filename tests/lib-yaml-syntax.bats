#
# Validates staged YAML. It has two arms and only one of them ever runs on a
# given machine, which is exactly why both need a test: pi1 has PyYAML, so the
# grep fallback would otherwise be code nobody has executed since it was
# written. `has_pyyaml` is decided by `python3 -c "import yaml"`, so overriding
# python3 is what reaches the second arm.
#
# Seams: this file calls git DIRECTLY rather than through common.sh, so the
# override is on git itself -- `rev-parse --show-toplevel` for the root and
# `diff --cached --name-only` for the staged list.
#
# Three things pinned here that the file does not currently get right; each is
# marked DEFECT and asserts the FIXED behaviour:
#
#   * `for file in $staged_compose` word-splits, so a staged path containing a
#     space is validated as two paths that do not exist -- and the `|| continue`
#     for a missing file turns that into a silent pass.
#   * :29 interpolates the path into `python3 -c "...open('$p')"`. A quote in
#     the path ends the literal.
#   * `return $errors` puts an unbounded count in a one-byte status. The only
#     caller, scripts/pre-commit:91, reads it as a boolean.
