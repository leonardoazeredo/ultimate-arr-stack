# scripts/configure-apps.sh — the API-driven app configurator.
#
# This is the most destructive script in the repo that a test is allowed near:
# it POSTs configuration into six live services and restarts two containers.
# Everything here runs behind tests/helpers/stubs.bash, and the headline test is
# the one that drives the WHOLE script with --dry-run and asserts that forbid()
# was never tripped — i.e. that the dry-run gate really does sit in front of
# every mutation, rather than in front of most of them.
#
# The script is sourced rather than executed. Its `main` runs only under the
# BASH_SOURCE guard, so sourcing gives direct access to the eight functions the
# refactor split out.
