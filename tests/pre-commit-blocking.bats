# Does scripts/pre-commit actually account for its errors, or does it just die?
#
# The hook maintains an ERRORS counter, and ends with a summary that reads
#
#     BLOCKED: $ERRORS error(s) found
#     ... To skip hooks (NOT RECOMMENDED): git commit --no-verify
#
# None of that could ever print. `set -e` is in force (scripts/pre-commit:8),
# and every blocking check does
#
#     if check_x; then ok; else ((ERRORS++)); fi
#
# `((ERRORS++))` is a POST-increment: it evaluates to the value BEFORE the
# increment, which on the first failure is 0, and a `((...))` command whose
# expression evaluates to 0 returns exit status 1. An else-branch is not a
# condition context, so errexit fires and the hook dies on the spot -- at the
# FIRST failing check, before the counter it just tried to raise is ever read.
#
# The same shape appears inside two libraries that the hook calls BARE (checks
# 5 and 7), where errexit is not suppressed either. check-hardcoded-domain.sh
# aborts at `((hostname_errors++))` (:73) partway through building its report,
# so the `ERROR: NAS hostname ...` message and the `return 1` at :81 -- the
# file's only non-zero return, commented at :58 as "BLOCKS" -- are both
# unreachable, and the hook's last line of output is an unrelated SKIP.
#
# The commit is still rejected, so this hides behind a correct-looking exit
# code. What is lost is everything else: the later checks never run (including
# the BLOCKING check 11), no summary prints, no --no-verify hint prints, and
# the count could never exceed 1 even if it did print.
#
# It is also blocking BY ACCIDENT, which makes it fragile in the worst
# direction: initialising ERRORS=1, or the obvious shellcheck-style cleanup to
# `ERRORS=$((ERRORS + 1))`, or appending `|| true`, each SILENTLY REMOVE the
# rejection for the first error. The tidy-up deletes the only thing making it
# work.
#
# So these tests run the real hook against a throwaway repo and assert on what
# it printed and how far it got -- not merely on its exit status, which was
# right for the wrong reason the whole time. Presence-is-not-behaviour is the
# trap this repo has already paid for (docs/TEST-HARDENING-LOG.md §5.1).
