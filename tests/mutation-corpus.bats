# Every corpus entry must still be able to change its target.
#
# run-mutations.sh treats "the mutation changed nothing" as a hard ERROR, because
# a pattern that stopped matching after a refactor would otherwise score a false
# KILLED. But that check runs only when somebody runs the corpus, and the
# per-push workflow does not: hundreds of entries, each running its oracle
# twice. (No count is written down here on purpose. The previous version said
# 271, which was true when it was written and false within the month, the same
# way CLAUDE.md's old "14 tests" claim went stale.) This file performs the same
# ASSERT step for every entry with no oracle at all: source each corpus with a
# recording `mutation()` stub, apply each --apply to a COPY of the target, and
# require the bytes to differ. Seconds instead of hours, and it catches both an
# inert pattern and a target that has been renamed away.
#
# GNU sed is a hard requirement of the corpus itself (see tests/mutation/README.md),
# so this skips on BSD sed -- naming the consequence, so the skip cannot be read as
# a pass.
