# The NAS sync path, tested by RUNNING it.

# tests/hooks-installed.bats already asserts the post-merge symlink exists. It
# passed for the hook's entire life while the hook did nothing at all: it
# derived the repo root from ${BASH_SOURCE[0]}, which git sets to the path
# inside the git dir (.git/hooks/post-merge). bash does not resolve that
# symlink, so `git -C .git/hooks rev-parse --show-toplevel` fatalled, `|| true`
# swallowed it, and an `exit 0` guard meant for "not a git repo" fired on every
# merge. Installed, executable, correctly targeted -- and inert.
#
# So these tests never inspect the text of the scripts. They build a throwaway
# git repo with a real origin, install the hook the way setup-hooks.sh does,
# invoke it the way git does, and assert on what actually happened.
