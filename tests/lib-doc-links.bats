#
# Walks every tracked .md file and resolves its internal links. Two seams are
# enough to drive it: `git ls-files` (the file list) and get_repo_root (where
# the paths are resolved from). Both are overridden here against a throwaway
# docs tree, so no test depends on the real repo's documentation staying still
# -- a test that asserted "the repo's own links are valid" would go red for
# reasons that have nothing to do with this file.
#
# Two things this file pins that the code does not currently get right, marked
# DEFECT where the assertion encodes the FIXED behaviour:
#
#   * `return $errors` puts an unbounded count into a one-byte exit status, so
#     256 broken links returns 0 and the hook says the docs are fine. The only
#     call site, scripts/pre-commit:174, is `if check_doc_links; then` -- it
#     reads the value as a boolean and always did, so the count was never
#     reaching anyone. It moves into the message, where it can be any size.
#   * :119 interpolates a path straight into `python3 -c "...normpath('$p')"`.
#     A path holding a single quote ends the string; the repo's own docs are
#     the input so the threat model is small, but the shape is the same one
#     that CVEs are written about, and passing argv costs nothing.
