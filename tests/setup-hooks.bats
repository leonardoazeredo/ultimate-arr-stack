# it passes on a developer box where someone ran setup-hooks by hand a year ago,
# and it would keep passing if this file were emptied tomorrow. It is the same
# presence-is-not-behaviour trap that let the post-merge hook sit installed,
# executable, correctly symlinked and entirely inert from the day it landed
# until 2026-08-31.
#
# So these tests RUN it, against a throwaway checkout with its own git repo, and
