# The interesting half of this script is the branch a test must NOT complete:
# `docker network rm`. Everything here runs behind tests/helpers/stubs.bash, so
# the one test that deliberately drives the removal path asserts the breadcrumb
# forbid() leaves rather than the removal happening.
#
# The script is sourced rather than executed for most tests. Its `main` runs
# only under the BASH_SOURCE guard, so sourcing gives direct access to
# check_one_network() without going through four networks first.
