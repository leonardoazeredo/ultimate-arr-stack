# A cron leak detector, so the failure that matters is the one where it reports
# OK. Two of these tests exist because it did exactly that: the headline check
# compared Gluetun's exit IP -- a PUBLIC address from ifconfig.me -- against
# `hostname -I`, a private LAN address, and behind NAT those can never be equal.
# It could not fire.
#
# The other recurring risk here is drift from tests/e2e/vpn-security.spec.ts,
# which this script's header says it must stay in sync with. Two of these tests
# derive both service lists from the two files and compare them, so the sync is
# asserted rather than asked for in a comment.
