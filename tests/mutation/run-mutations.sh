# Mutation testing for the bats suite.
#
# Why this exists: four separate times in this project a test was merged as
# coverage while being incapable of failing. Reading them did not catch it --
# in every case they read correctly. Breaking the thing they guard and watching
# them stay green is what caught it. This script does that mechanically instead
# of by hand.
#
# For each mutation in a corpus:
#   1. CONTROL   - run the named test(s) unmutated. They must PASS, and at
#                  least one must actually have run. A `-f` filter that matches
#                  nothing exits 0 with `1..0`, which reads exactly like a pass.
#   2. APPLY     - break the target file.
#   3. ASSERT    - the file's checksum MUST have changed. A mutation that did
#                  not apply (a regex that stopped matching after a refactor)
#                  produces a green run and a false KILLED. This project has
#                  already shipped one harness that reported five passes for
#                  exactly this reason, because its guard inverted its own exit
#                  status. Nothing here is believed before this check.
#   4. RUN       - the named test(s) must now FAIL. If they pass, the test
#                  cannot detect the defect it exists to detect: SURVIVED.
#   5. RESTORE   - from a byte copy, verified by checksum. Enforced by an EXIT
#                  trap, so a Ctrl-C never leaves a mutated tree behind.
#
# Usage:
#   ./tests/mutation/run-mutations.sh [-k <substring>] [corpus.sh ...]
#
# With no corpus argument, every tests/mutation/corpus/*.sh is run.
# -k restricts to mutation ids containing <substring>.
