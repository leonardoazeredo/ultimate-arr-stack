# Mutations for scripts/configure-apps.sh.
#
# Safe to run: tests/configure-apps.bats sources the script rather than
# executing it, answers every docker question from a fixture directory, points
# CONFIGURE_ENV_FILE and TMPDIR at throwaway paths, and keeps the stub harness
# on PATH. The two mutations that delete a --dry-run gate below therefore reach
# forbid() rather than a live `docker restart pihole` or a POST into a running
# qBittorrent.

  --bats tests/configure-apps.bats \
  --test "configure-apps: the help block is derived from the file, not a fixed length" \
  --why "restores the head -27 | tail -24 extractor this pass replaced. It was already wrong when it was found - the header runs to line 29, so --help silently dropped its last two lines - and a hardcoded range goes stale again the moment anyone edits the header, with nothing to say so" \

mutation configure-apps-unknown-option-tolerated \
  --file scripts/configure-apps.sh \
  --bats tests/configure-apps.bats \
  --test "configure-apps: an unknown option is named and fails without exiting" \

  --file scripts/configure-apps.sh \
  --bats tests/configure-apps.bats \
  --test "configure-apps: env_value keeps everything after the first =" \
  --why "goes back to cut -d= -f2, which truncates any value containing an = at the second one. A qBittorrent password is exactly the kind of value that contains one, and the truncated half authenticates as cleanly as a wrong password does - which is to say not at all, with no clue why" \

mutation configure-apps-env-value-keeps-quotes \
  --file scripts/configure-apps.sh \
  --bats tests/configure-apps.bats \
  --test "configure-apps: env_value strips one layer of double quotes" \
  --why "drops the quote stripping. .env files in this repo quote values as a matter of style, so the password was handed to qBittorrent with its quotes still attached and simply failed to log in - the failure surfaces as an auth error, which points at the credential rather than at the parser" \
  --apply 'sed -i "/^    line=\"\${line%/d" "$F"'

mutation configure-apps-env-file-read-relatively \
  --file scripts/configure-apps.sh \
  --bats tests/configure-apps.bats \
  --test "configure-apps: .env is resolved from the script, not the working directory" \
  --why "reads the bare relative path .env again. Run from anywhere but the repo root the lookup silently finds nothing and falls through to scraping docker logs, so the configured password is ignored in favour of a first-boot temporary one that may no longer be valid" \

  --file scripts/configure-apps.sh \
  --bats tests/configure-apps.bats \
  --test "configure-apps: check_prerequisites returns rather than exits, so main can report" \
  --why "puts back the bare exit 1. It looks identical from the shell - same status - but it kills the caller from inside a function, so main can never clean up its cookie file or print a summary, and the script becomes untestable without a subprocess per assertion" \

  --file scripts/configure-apps.sh \
  --bats tests/configure-apps.bats \
  --test "configure-apps: a container whose name merely contains a required one does not count" \
  --why "drops the anchors from the running-container check. This NAS runs gluetun-exit alongside gluetun, so an unanchored match reports the VPN as present when only the exit-node tunnel is up, and the script then waits four minutes for services that share a namespace which does not exist" \

  --test "configure-apps: a missing arr key is reported as a failure, not skipped silently" \

  --test "configure-apps: a QBIT_PASSWORD in the environment wins over everything else" \

  --test "configure-apps: the most recent temp password in the logs is the one used" \
  --why "takes the first temporary password in the log instead of the last. qBittorrent mints a new one on every restart and never removes the old lines, so on any container that has restarted once this picks a password that expired days ago" \

mutation configure-apps-failed-count-is-decorative \
  --file scripts/configure-apps.sh \
  --bats tests/configure-apps.bats \
  --test "configure-apps: FAILED is not decorative — a failure makes the script exit non-zero" \
  --why "prints the failure count and then discards it, which is what the script did before this pass: it exited 0 whether it had configured everything or nothing. An accumulator that cannot change the outcome is the exact shape this repo keeps finding in its own guards" \

  --test "configure-apps: the session cookie is a private temp file, removed on exit" \

  --test "configure-apps: the session cookie is a private temp file, removed on exit" \
  --why "goes back to a fixed, predictable filename in a world-writable directory - one session cookie shared by every run, so two concurrent runs clobber each other's session and anything else on the box can read it.

  --test "configure-apps: a successful qBittorrent login proceeds to configure it" \
