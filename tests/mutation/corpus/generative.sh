# Corpus: the generative half's own guards.
# (sourced by run-mutations.sh, never executed - hence a directive, not a shebang)
#
# run-generated.sh, mutator.sh and lib-mutate.sh are verification tools, so they
# get the treatment they impose. Every guard below was added because something
# went wrong without it; each entry proves the guard is capable of noticing.
#
# These mutate files that run-mutations.sh has already sourced or will only
# invoke as a child process. `sed -i` writes a temp file and renames it, so the
# running bash keeps its original inode, and a sourced file is read once at
# source time -- the already-loaded function bodies are unaffected. The mutation
# is visible only to the child the fixture spawns, which is the thing under test.
