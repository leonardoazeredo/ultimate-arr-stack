# --- the runner's own restore path ------------------------------------------
# These mutate lib-mutate.sh, which run-mutations.sh has already sourced. That is
# safe for a reason worth stating: `sed -i` writes a temp file and renames it,
# so the running bash keeps its original inode and finishes reading the script
# it started with -- and a sourced file is read once, at source time, so the
# already-loaded function bodies are equally unaffected. The mutation is visible
# only to the child runner the fixture spawns, which is exactly the thing under
# test. These four moved from run-mutations.sh to lib-mutate.sh when the restore
# core was extracted; they are the reason that refactor was caught leaving five
# mutated files in the tree.
