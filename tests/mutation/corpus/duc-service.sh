# Safe to run: tests/duc-service.bats points every path at a throwaway tree via
# the DUC_* seams and answers `duc` from a PATH stub, so nothing here indexes
# /volume1, writes /etc/cron.d, or starts nginx.

mutation duc-awk-nf-not-a-predicate \
  --file duc-service/app/startup.sh \
  --bats tests/duc-service.bats \
  --test "duc: valid_schedule rejects the values that used to reach cron unchecked" \
  --why "restores the shipped check, \`echo \$SCHEDULE | awk 'NF==5'\`. awk with a pattern and no action is a PRINT FILTER: it exits 0 whatever it matched, so the negation was never true and the fallback under it was unreachable code. Any value at all went into /etc/cron.d, where cron ignores a malformed line silently and the daily scan just never runs" \
  --apply 'sed -i "s@^    printf .%s. \"\${1-}\" | awk .*\$@    echo \"\${1-}\" | awk '"'"'NF==5'"'"' >/dev/null 2>\&1@" "$F"'

mutation duc-schedule-multiline-accepted \
  --file duc-service/app/startup.sh \
  --bats tests/duc-service.bats \
  --test "duc: valid_schedule rejects a multi-line schedule" \
  --why "drops the one-line requirement, keeping only the field count. /etc/cron.d is newline-delimited, so a SCHEDULE whose first line looks valid appends whatever follows it as further crontab lines - running as root, on a container that mounts all of /volume1" \
  --apply 'sed -i "s@exit !(ok \&\& NR == 1)@exit !ok@" "$F"'

mutation duc-cron-poller-line-dropped \
  --file duc-service/app/startup.sh \
  --bats tests/duc-service.bats \
  --test "duc: the cron file runs the poller every minute and the scan on schedule" \
  --why "removes the once-a-minute poller from the generated crontab. The scheduled scan still runs, so duc looks entirely healthy - but every manual scan request queued from the web UI sits in /tmp forever with nothing to consume it" \
  --apply 'sed -i "\@^        echo \"\* \* \* \* \* root \$MANUAL_SCAN_SH\"\$@d" "$F"'

mutation duc-cron-file-not-readable \
  --file duc-service/app/startup.sh \
  --bats tests/duc-service.bats \
  --test "duc: the cron file is world-readable, which cron requires" \
  --why "writes the cron file 0600. cron refuses to load a /etc/cron.d entry it cannot read as the invoking user and says nothing about it, so both the scheduled scan and the poller vanish with no error anywhere" \
  --apply 'sed -i "s@^    chmod 0644 \"\$dest\"\$@    chmod 0600 \"\$dest\"@" "$F"'

mutation duc-initial-scan-failure-is-fatal \
  --file duc-service/app/startup.sh \
  --bats tests/duc-service.bats \
  --test "duc: a failed initial scan does not stop the container coming up" \
  --why "lets a failing initial index kill startup under set -e. The web UI and the crontab both matter more than the first scan: this turns one bad index into a container that never serves anything again, and restart: always makes it a crash loop" \

mutation duc-scan-failure-loses-the-log-line \
  --file duc-service/app/scan.sh \
  --bats tests/duc-service.bats \
  --test "duc: a failing index still logs the end of the scan and its exit code" \
  --why "restores the shipped form. The block runs in a pipeline subshell that inherits set -e, so a failing duc killed it on the spot and both 'status=\$?' and the End of scan line were unreachable. The exit status still propagated via PIPESTATUS, which is exactly why this read as correct: the only symptom was a log that stopped mid-scan" \

mutation duc-scan-status-from-tee \
  --file duc-service/app/scan.sh \
  --bats tests/duc-service.bats \
  --test "duc: scan.sh reports the index's status, not tee's" \
  --why "takes the status from the pipeline instead of from PIPESTATUS[0], and drops pipefail. Deliberately mutates BOTH: either one alone is an equivalent mutant, because PIPESTATUS and pipefail each independently carry the index's status out past tee. Together they are the guarantee, and without them tee's success - it succeeds whatever it is fed - turns every failed index into a completed scan, which the poller then believes when deciding whether to keep a queued request" \

mutation duc-lock-trap-armed-too-early \
  --file duc-service/app/scan.sh \
  --bats tests/duc-service.bats \
  --test "duc: a held lock is left alone, not removed by the run that could not take it" \
  --why "arms the cleanup trap before the lock is actually acquired, so an invocation that was correctly turned away deletes the RUNNING scan's lock on its way out. The next tick of the poller then starts a second concurrent index over all of /volume1" \

  --file duc-service/app/scan.sh \
  --bats tests/duc-service.bats \
  --test "duc: a request arriving mid-scan is kept, not silently dropped" \
  --why "returns 0 when the lock is held, which is how this shipped. 'I did not scan' and 'I scanned' become the same answer, and the poller - which can only decide what to do with the request from that answer - discards it. The user's manual scan never happens and nothing anywhere reports a problem" \

  --file duc-service/app/manual_scan.sh \

  --test "duc: a request arriving mid-scan is kept, not silently dropped" \
  --why "clears the request on the already-running branch too. Same lost scan as the mutation above, reached from the consumer's side rather than the producer's - the two are separate entries because either file alone can reintroduce it" \

  --file duc-service/app/manual_scan.sh \
  --bats tests/duc-service.bats \
  --test "duc: a failed manual scan clears the request instead of retrying forever" \
  --why "keeps the request after a genuine failure. The poller runs every minute, so a scan that is broken for any lasting reason re-runs sixty times an hour, each one appending a failure line to the log the web UI serves. Addressed from the \`*)\` arm onward because both arms clear the request with the same line - only their position distinguishes them" \

  --file duc-service/app/manual_scan.cgi \
  --bats tests/duc-service.bats \
  --test "duc: the cgi shows the running scan's log instead of queueing" \
  --why "drops the in-progress branch, so pressing the button during a scan queues another one instead of showing progress. The poller then starts a second full index of /volume1 the moment the first finishes, every time" \

  --bats tests/duc-service.bats \
  --test "duc: the cgi still returns a body when the log file does not exist yet" \
  --why "removes the fallback for an absent log. Under set -e the script dies AFTER the headers have gone out, so a fresh container answers the status page with a truncated response and no explanation" \
