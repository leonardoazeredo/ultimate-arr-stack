# Corpus: scripts/queue-cleanup.sh, scripts/fix-*.sh and the three Python
# modules they call.
# (sourced by run-mutations.sh, never executed - hence a directive, not a shebang)
#
# These were heredocs and ad-hoc `.env` greps until 2026-09-01, with no test of
# any kind. Four of the defects catalogued for the coverage plan lived here, and
# every one of them was silent: --apply that renamed nothing, an API key
# truncated at an '=', a dry run that trimmed the log anyway, and a pagination
# loop with no exit. Each entry below reintroduces one and requires the test
# that now covers it to go red.
#
# The Python entries all name the same bats test, because tests/python-suite.bats
# is the bridge that runs pytest -- a failure anywhere under tests/python/ comes
# back through it. The pytest file and function are named in --why instead.
