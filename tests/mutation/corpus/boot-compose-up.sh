mutation boot-magnetio-missing-from-stacks \
  --file scripts/boot-compose-up.sh \
  --bats tests/boot-compose-up.bats \
  --test "boot-compose-up: every compose file in this repo is in STACKS" \
  --why "drops a compose file from the boot list, which is the state this script was actually in: magnetio was absent from the day it was added. A stack that is never brought up produces no error, no FAILED line, and a log that ends 'finished clean' - the reboot equivalent of a container that is running with no published ports, which is the failure this script exists to fix" \

mutation boot-consumer-before-network-owner \
  --file scripts/boot-compose-up.sh \
  --bats tests/boot-compose-up.bats \
  --test "boot-compose-up: STACKS orders network owners before their consumers" \
  --why "brings traefik up before the file that creates the network traefik declares external. Docker networks survive a reboot, so this is invisible on a NAS that has been up before - and fires the first time this runs after a network prune or on a rebuilt NAS, which is exactly when nobody is reading the log" \

  --file scripts/boot-compose-up.sh \
  --bats tests/boot-compose-up.bats \
  --test "boot-compose-up: magnetio comes up before arr-stack" \
  --why "puts magnetio after arr-stack. arr-stack.yml declares magnetio-net external and gluetun joins it, so on a machine where that network does not yet exist gluetun fails - and gluetun failing takes the whole arr-stack file with it, including pihole" \

mutation boot-first-failure-aborts-the-loop \
  --file scripts/boot-compose-up.sh \
  --bats tests/boot-compose-up.bats \
  --test "boot-compose-up: one failing stack does not stop the rest" \
  --why "stops the loop at the first stack that fails. DNS matters more than Immich: one bad stack early in the list would leave the entire NAS unreconciled after a reboot, which is the precise condition this script was written to fix" \

mutation boot-missing-stack-is-fatal \
  --file scripts/boot-compose-up.sh \
  --bats tests/boot-compose-up.bats \
  --test "boot-compose-up: a missing stack is skipped, not fatal" \
  --why "treats an absent compose file as a failure. frigate, immich and therapy-stack are other deployments that may not be on this NAS at all - CLAUDE.md records therapy-stack as verified absent - so this turns every single boot into a reported failure and trains whoever reads the log to stop reading it" \

  --file scripts/boot-compose-up.sh \
  --bats tests/boot-compose-up.bats \
  --test "boot-compose-up: one failing stack does not stop the rest" \
  --why "drops the non-zero exit after failures, which is how this script shipped: \`failed\` was accumulated, printed, and then could not affect the outcome. Running it by hand to check a reboot went cleanly gave 0 either way" \
  --apply 'sed -i "/=== finished WITH FAILURES/,/^fi\$/{/^    exit 1\$/d}" "$F"'

mutation boot-readiness-give-up-falls-through \
  --file scripts/boot-compose-up.sh \
  --bats tests/boot-compose-up.bats \
  --test "boot-compose-up: it gives up rather than looping forever" \
  --why "logs the give-up message and then carries on anyway with no docker. Every stack is attempted, every one fails, and the log fills with six FAILED lines whose real cause is the one line above them - which is how a legible boot failure becomes an unreadable one. Note the mutation is a fall-through rather than an unbounded loop: a mutant that never terminates hangs the whole corpus run instead of failing it" \
  --apply 'sed -i "/docker never became ready/{n;s@^        exit 1\$@        break@}" "$F"'

mutation boot-log-trim-disabled \
  --file scripts/boot-compose-up.sh \
  --bats tests/boot-compose-up.bats \
  --test "boot-compose-up: an oversized log is trimmed to its last 500 lines" \
  --why "raises the trim threshold beyond anything the log will reach. There is no logrotate on this NAS, so the file grows until the volume does not - and the volume filling is a stack-wide failure whose cause is a log nobody was looking at" \
  --apply 'sed -i "s@-gt 1000000 \]@-gt 100000000000 ]@" "$F"'

mutation boot-remove-orphans \
  --file scripts/boot-compose-up.sh \
  --bats tests/boot-compose-up.bats \
  --test "boot-compose-up: --remove-orphans and 'down' never appear in any argv" \
  --why "adds --remove-orphans to the boot bring-up. The stack's services are split across compose files sharing one project name, so every container defined by the other files looks like an orphan to each individual file. This took out 11 containers on 2026-08-01; at boot it would do it to all of them in sequence" \
