# Mutations for the pre-commit hook's error accounting.
#
# The hook kept an ERRORS counter and ended with a "BLOCKED: $ERRORS error(s)
# found" summary that could never print. Under `set -e`, `((ERRORS++))` in an
# else-branch returns status 1 on the FIRST failure (post-increment evaluates
# to the pre-increment value, 0, and `((0))` is exit 1), so the hook died at
# its first finding -- before reading the counter, before the summary, before
# checks 6-11, and inside check 5's library before that check's own error
# message was ever echoed.
#
# It still exited 1, which is why nothing noticed for so long: the verdict was
# right and everything explaining the verdict was missing.
#
# These entries exist because the fix is a shape that looks like a no-op. Anyone
# tidying `ERRORS=$((ERRORS + 1))` back into the terser `((ERRORS++))` is making
# what reads as a pure style edit, and would silently restore the bug. The whole
# hazard here is that the correct code and the broken code look interchangeable.
#
# Safe to run: the mutations touch only the hook and its libraries, and the
# tests drive them against a throwaway git repo in $BATS_TEST_TMPDIR.
