# A mutation tool exists to inject pathological code, so "this mutant loops
# forever" is the expected case rather than an edge one -- and an oracle with no
# bound turns one bad mutant into an unbounded sweep. Observed 2026-09-01: a
# sweep of scripts/lib/configure-helpers.sh ran past a 90-minute cap having
# scored 3 of its 31 mutants, and only an external `timeout` ended it.
#
# `timeout` execs its argument, so this wraps the runner script itself; wrapping
# a shell function would do nothing (recorded trap, TEST-HARDENING-LOG section 8).
# A run that hits the budget comes back as status 124, which the caller scores as
# a kill -- the suite demonstrably did not pass -- but reports distinctly,
# because a hang and a clean red are the same number and very different problems.
#
# `timeout` bounds wall clock only. It does not bound memory, and a mutant that
# loops *allocating* -- not just spinning -- can exhaust the host before the
# clock runs out: `run-generated.sh` against scripts/lib/queue_cleanup.py did
# exactly that on 2026-09-02, rebooting this 1.8 GiB host twice. That mutant
# routed through the containerised pytest.sh, which now carries its own
# `ulimit -v`; this native path (every bash-side bats file) had no equivalent
# bound. `ulimit -v` sets RLIMIT_AS, a kernel rlimit -- no cgroup or privilege
# needed, so it applies here exactly as it does inside the container. Measured
# the same day: tests/lib-configure-helpers.bats (55 tests) is the heaviest
# native file checked and passes clean at 32 MB; 256 MB is 8x that floor and
# ~7x below host RAM, so it bounds a runaway mutant without ever touching a
# real run.
#
# `-S`, soft limit only: this process (run-mutations.sh/run-generated.sh)
# calls run_tests() itself, on every mutant, including ones that target this
# very function -- a bare `ulimit -v` sets the hard limit too, which a
# descendant can never raise again. That turned this repo's own mutation
# corpus entry for this guard into an unwinnable test: the harness's own
# unmutated control run had already capped the hard ceiling for the whole
# process tree before the mutated run ever got a chance to prove anything.
# The soft limit alone still stops a runaway allocator -- that is what
# RLIMIT_AS enforcement actually checks -- without leaving that trap behind.

# independent of what it actually uses). 2 GiB exceeds this host's entire
# 1.8 GiB of physical RAM, so no single cap value can both bound a runaway
# native mutant and let docker run; the two goals are incompatible for any
# bats file that shells out to a *real* daemon (not a stubbed `docker` on
# PATH -- those still get capped, same as anything else). Every file below
# does that in at least one of its own test bodies (`docker run`, `docker

#     nothing here for a bash mutant to make loop-and-allocate.
# A hardcoded list rather than a live grep: cheap, and a new docker-shelling
