# Generative mutation testing: the discovery half.
#
# run-mutations.sh replays a corpus of defects someone already knew about. It
# cannot find a gap nobody has thought of -- every entry in it is a bug that was
# written down after the fact. This script is the other half: universalmutator
# perturbs the source systematically, and any mutant the suite fails to kill is
# a hole in the tests that no one had to think of first.
#
# That is not hypothetical here. `grep -Fxq` -> `grep -Fq` in the backup volume
# resolver survived all 18 tests around it; the exact-match property was
# completely uncovered, and because volume names nest, a substring match
# silently mis-resolves and a volume fails to back up. Review did not find it.
#
# NON-BLOCKING BY DESIGN. This always exits 0. Generated mutants include
# equivalent ones -- mutations that change the text without changing behaviour --
# which can never be killed by any test and are not defects. A discovery tool
# that can wedge the workflow on an irreducible false-positive rate gets
# disabled, and then it finds nothing at all. run-mutations.sh stays the only
# blocking gate.
#
# Usage:
#   ./tests/mutation/run-generated.sh [-k <substring>] [target ...]
#
# With no target argument, every file in the TARGETS map below is swept.
# -k restricts to targets whose path contains <substring>.

# Overridable so a test can exercise the ledger-merge rules without writing to
# the repo's real one. It used to be hardcoded, and tests/mutation-framework.bats
# had to overwrite the tracked file in place and copy it back afterwards. That
# restore is a bare `cp` with nothing guarding it, so an interrupt anywhere in
# the sweep -- a timeout, a Ctrl-C -- left the committed ledger holding the
# test's sentinel rows. Observed, not theorised: a 2-minute timeout during this
# work did exactly that, and the wreckage looked enough like real triage output
# to be committed by accident.

# target file : bats oracle : test-name regex
#
# One table, same shape as the corpus's --file/--bats/--test triple. A target
# with no oracle does not belong here: against an untested file EVERY mutant
# survives by construction, which is not a finding, it is a restatement of
# "this file has no tests" -- and a few hundred guaranteed survivors would bury
# the real signal. The scripts/lib/ files that still have no oracle are recorded
# as a missing-test gap in tests/mutation/README.md instead of being swept.
#
# No count is written down here on purpose. This table IS the list of covered
# files, so a number beside it can only ever disagree with it; the staleness
# test in tests/shellcheck.bats derives the uncovered set from field 1 at run
# time rather than from anything anyone remembered to edit.
TARGETS=(
# The third field is a bats `-f` regex, so it is anchored: an unanchored
# substring would silently widen the oracle as tests are added, and a mutant
# that then survived would have survived for a reason unrelated to coverage.
