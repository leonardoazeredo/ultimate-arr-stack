  // Targets the documented 2026-08-01 incident: Traefik can be recreated via
  // the wrong compose file, silently lose its traefik-lan macvlan, and keep
  // reporting healthy while every .lan URL is actually dead. A container
  // health check can't see this — only an end-to-end HTTP request through
  // Traefik's actual routing logic can. Send the Host header directly to
  // TRAEFIK_LAN_IP rather than relying on the test runner's own DNS
  // resolution working, so this test isolates Traefik's routing specifically.
  //
  // Every `.lan` host redirects http→https, and all but one require
  // basicauth. Jellyfin is the exception, deliberately — see
  // docs/HTTPS-LOCAL.md. sonarr.lan represents the original admin-tier hosts
  // and seerr.lan the media tier, which has its own app-level login in
  // addition to this gate. homepage.lan, duc.lan and beszel.lan are covered
  // individually rather than as representatives: since their host ports were
  // removed, basicauth here is their only access control, so "the mechanism
  // is shared, one host is enough" no longer holds for them. Jellyfin is
  // asserted separately below, because it is deliberately NOT behind
  // admin-auth.
  //
  // Deliberate coverage gap: these tests only prove the 401-without-creds
  // gate, not that a *credentialed* request reaches the right backend -
  // admin-auth short-circuits before Traefik ever forwards the request, so a
  // dead/misconfigured backend would also return 401 and pass here. Doing
  // better would mean wiring a dedicated test-only basicauth credential into
  // .env.e2e (the human admin-auth password isn't available to this suite,
  // and reusing it would leak into `.env.e2e`, an inappropriate place for a
  // credential shared with real devices) - out of scope for this change.
  // Backend health for Jellyfin/Seerr specifically is already covered
  // independently by ui-screenshots.spec.ts, which logs into both via their
  // direct LAN-published ports (bypassing Traefik entirely).

  // Can't use Playwright's `request` fixture with a spoofed Host header
  // here: Traefik's `sniStrict: true` (tls.yml) rejects the TLS
  // handshake outright unless the *SNI* itself is a real `.lan`
  // hostname (confirmed live - connecting by bare IP gets a TLS
  // "unrecognized_name" alert before any HTTP response), and
  // Playwright's request context has no way to set SNI independently of
  // the connection address (tried dns.setServers() to make the hostname
  // resolve for real - it doesn't work, Playwright's fixture resolves
  // through a path that ignores it, unlike the historical
  // dns.resolve4/6-vs-dns.lookup() distinction documented in git
  // history for this file). Node's own `https` module *does* expose SNI
  // (`servername`) separately from the connection target, exactly like
  // curl's `--resolve` - use it directly instead.
  //
  // rejectUnauthorized stays false because the mkcert CA root never
  // leaves the machine that generated it (see docs/HTTPS-LOCAL.md) - the
  // e2e runner has no copy to verify against. Asserting on the presented
  // cert's own SAN list instead catches the actual regression this
  // guards against: a stale/wrong cert deployed without this host in its
  // SAN list still completes a TLS handshake (mkcert leaf, just for the
  // wrong names) but wouldn't list `domain` under subjectaltname.
  // The `.lan` hosts under test. homepage/duc/beszel are here specifically
  // because they no longer publish a host port — Traefik's admin-auth is now
  // the ONLY thing standing in front of them, so a middleware removed from
  // traefik/dynamic/local-services.yml would otherwise leave every test green
  // while the service went unauthenticated on the LAN. jellyfin.lan redirects
  // like the rest but is deliberately not auth-gated, so it appears only in
  // the redirect list and gets its own assertion below.
