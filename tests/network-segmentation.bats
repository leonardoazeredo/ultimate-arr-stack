# Live network segmentation tests — VLAN20 (personal) -> VLAN10 (services).
#
# Why this file exists: every other bats file here checks compose TEXT. Nothing
# checked the actual network, which is exactly how an unrestricted VLAN20->VLAN10
# forward survived unnoticed until a manual audit found it. These assert the
# router's allow-list as it actually behaves, from a host sitting on VLAN20.
#
# Vantage point: must run from a host with an address on VLAN20 (pi1). Anywhere
# else — CI runners, the NAS itself, a laptop on another VLAN — every test skips
# rather than failing, the same gate pattern tests/e2e/helpers.ts uses for Docker.
#
# The allow-list mirrors the router rules `vlan20-to-nas-svcs`,
# `vlan20-to-pihole-dns` and `vlan20-to-traefik`. If you change a rule, change
# this file in the same commit — a silent divergence here is worse than no test.
#
# NOT asserted, deliberately: the router's own :22 is reachable from this host.
# That is `Allow-pi1-router-mgmt`, an INPUT rule with no `dest`, so it matches
# any router interface including the VLAN10 one. It is a deliberate pinhole, not
# a forwarding hole, and asserting it blocked would encode a false expectation.

# NOT tested, and why: there is no non-vacuous denied-port assertion to make
# against Traefik. Probed from the NAS itself (i.e. from inside VLAN10, where
# the firewall is not in the way), 192.168.110.250 accepts 80 and 443 and
# nothing else - 8080, 8082 and 9090 are all closed there. Asserting any of
# them blocked from VLAN20 would be a test that cannot fail, which is the exact
# defect this file exists to avoid. If Traefik ever publishes another port,
# mirror the derived-denied-set approach used for the NAS above.
