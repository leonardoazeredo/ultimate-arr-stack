# The @reboot job that reconciles every deployed stack. It exists because a UGOS
# update once left every container running with no published ports -- Pi-hole
# reported healthy while nothing outside could reach it and the whole house lost
# DNS. So the failure mode that matters here is the one where this script runs,
# reports success, and has silently not covered something.
#
# Two things are therefore derived from the repo rather than restated: which
# compose files it brings up, and in what order. Both were wrong in a sibling
# script, and neither is visible in an exit status.
#
# POSIX sh, not bash. The loop is extracted and eval'd for the tests that need a
# clean run -- `docker compose up` is on the stub denylist, so a subprocess run
# can never reach the success path, which is exactly the guarantee wanted for
# every other test in this file.
